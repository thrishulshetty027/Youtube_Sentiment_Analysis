# YouTube Sentiment Analysis using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project performs sentiment analysis on YouTube video titles using machine learning and natural language processing techniques. The sentiment is classified as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.

## Dataset
- YouTube Trending Videos Dataset (multi-country)
- Titles from multiple regions were combined into a single dataset

## Methodology
1. Data loading and merging
2. Text preprocessing (cleaning, stopword removal)
3. Automatic sentiment labeling using VADER
4. Feature extraction using TF-IDF
5. Model training using Logistic Regression
6. Evaluation using accuracy and classification metrics
7. Visualization using sentiment plots and word clouds

## Machine Learning Model
- Logistic Regression
- TF-IDF Vectorization (unigrams + bigrams)

## Visualizations
- Sentiment distribution bar plot
- Sentiment-wise word clouds

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, Scikit-learn
- NLTK
- WordCloud
- Matplotlib

## Future Improvements
- Use real YouTube comments via API
- Apply deep learning models (LSTM, BERT)
- Deploy as a web app using Streamlit
